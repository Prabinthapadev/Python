# performing the different operations by using the availiable operators in python
# Arithmetic Operator:operators like:addition,subtraction,multiply,divide,modolus etc.
# eg:
# n1 = 4
# n2 = 5
# print(n1+n2);
# print(n1-n2);
# print(n1*n2);
# print(n1/n2);
# print(n1%n2);

# assignment operators
# these operators are used to assign value to the variable eg:
# a = 10
# b=0
# b += a
# print(b)

# logical operators
# these operators are used in the logical portions eg:
# a = 2
# b = 3
# if a == b:
#     {
#         print("A is equal to b")
#     }
# else:
#     print("B is greater than a")

# program to check if user input age eligible for voting.
#
# age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
# if age>=18:
#         print("You can vote")
#
# else:
#     print("You cannot vote")


# Type Casting

# num = 10;
# value = float(num)
# print(value)
# n = 2.44
# m = int(n);
# print(m)

# typecasting string to boolean

# str ="Prabin"
# isinput = bool(str);
# print(isinput)
# here if the string contains value then it returns true instead if it is null then it returns false

# to take input from user we use input() function/method
# example
# num = int(input("Enter a number:"))
# print(num)
